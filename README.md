## Brief Resume

### Data binding

Output Data
* String Interpolation --> {{data}}
* Property Binding --> [property]="data"

React to (User) Events
* Event Binding --> (event)="expression"

Combination of Both
* Two-Way-Binding --> [(ngModel)]="data"

   To use it you have to add ```FormsModule``` to the ```imports[]``` array in the AppModule
   and then also add the import  ```import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';```
   
### Directives
* ngIf
* ngStyle
* ngClass
* ngFor

## Getting Started
Install nodejs in your computer. [Download NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/)

Now install globally angular with this command:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Start a new project:
```
ng new name-of-project
```
with this option, we are setting up routing and sass:
```
ng new name-of-project --routing --style=sass
```
### Working On

To set up the project use: (It should be running on localost:4200)
```
ng serve -o
```

To generate a new component use:
```
ng generate component name-of-component
```
or
```
ng g c name-of-component
```

To install more npm packages use:
```
npm install package-name --save
```

To use Http module, you need to install Angular's HttpModule
```
npm install --save @angular/http
```
and then, in 'AppMOdule, add the 'HttpModule' to the 'imports[]':
```
import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http';
...
imports: [..., HttpModule]
```

### Building

To install Bootstrap v4 use
```
npm install --save bootstrap@
```
and add the following code to 'angular.json' file:
```
"build": {...
            "styles": [
              "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
              "src/styles.sass"
            ],...
```
## Deployment

The [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML/Elemento/button) (Mozilla Developer Network) offers nice list of all properties and events of the element you're interested in.

Before building an app, planning it by:
* Feature
* Component
* Data model
